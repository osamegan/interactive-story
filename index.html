She feels at peace for a bit, she is not the only one anymore. Everyone stares at Annie as her mother introduces her.  \n Annie's Mother: "Everyone, this is Annie, the daughter I told you about, she is one of us now,"  \n Annie’s mom takes her to her home and shows her some of the things she and her dad made for Annie when she was little. Annie’s mother spent 3 years training Annie to learn her powers, making sure she would use them for good and good only. Annie learns how to control her anger and not let her anger interfere with her powers. Annie’s mother told her plenty of things of the dark world, their enemy was a cult of dark magic that they would often have to fight against. The cult would come to their village every year with some new magic to try and finally kill the rest of the village.  \nAnnie's mother: "There was a war many years before you were born, many of our kind died and we’re all that’s left now." \n One night Annie woke up from a nightmare, she tried to calm herself down telling herself it was just a dream. She goes outside to relax for a bit and just as she’s about to open the door she hears something fall behind her. She turns around and there is a guy dressed in all black and his face is covered by a hood. \n Boy: "Annie,"" he says, "My name is Owen, I have important information you want if you wish to bring your sister back."\n Annie realized this was someone who isn’t her kind, no one her kind dresses like that. Out of curiosity, she agrees to listen.\n Owen: "Your sister, I can bring her back."   \nAnnie: "How?" \n Owen: "There’s a spell in a book we have, where you can bring your sister back the only way to cast it is by sacrificing the thing you love most, either your mother or your father, you choose."  \n Annie: "Where is it?"  \nOwen: "It's in my village, if you wish to bring your sister back you must come with me,"  \nAnnie’s mother wakes up and felt his presence, "he’s here," she thinks to herself. She hides around the corner hearing the conversation between Annie and Owen. She knows Annie would never be gullible enough to leave with him. The talking stops, there’s silence, out of curiosity she peers around the corner just as she sees Annie is about to grab his hand and leave. \nAnnie's Mother (scream): "Annie, no, we’ll find another way!" \nAnnie has to make a decision now, does she wait to see if she can find another way or does she take her chance now and leave?`,

         text : `Annie turned to her mother and waved goodbye with her other hand. In the blink of an eye, she was in Owen’s village. He told her to stay and left the room. He came back with a book in his hands. She reached for it and just as she was about tograb it, he pulled it away.  \nOwen: "No.I will give you this on one condition.” \nAnnie : “What is it?”  \nwen: “You must betray your kind and join us,”  \nAnnie thinks to herself, I can find a way around it. “Okay,” she says. He hands her the book and then took her to the room where she will be living in the village now. She reads the book, “step one” it says, “go to the place where the person died.” She closes the book and thinks to herself, Ii I run off I need to know how to defend myself, she sneaks around and finds a library full of dark magic books. She pulls a few of them off the shelf and starts reading, she spends the night reading and learning how to use dark magic to defend herself. It was everything she could hope for. The morning comes, it’s 3 am and she takes the book and sneaks out her room into her home village, she peers into her home, her mother isn’t there. She enters inside and the first thing she grabs is Tibbers, she wasn't leaving him behind. She goes to her mother's pillow, she sees a hair, exactly what she needed. She grabs the hair and goes to the woods. She makes her way back to the waterfall where her sister fell and died. Owen goes to her room at about 7 am, and knocks. \n Owen: “Annie it’s time to introduce you to everyone, come out.” \nNo response. He twists the doorknob, it’s unlocked. “Where has she gone?” he thinks to himself. He looks around the village and she is nowhere in sight, at that very moment he realizes, she left with the book. In fury, he gathers the village together and explains to them what had happened. \nOwen: “We must find her before she can bring back her sister, everyone stay on guard, spread out throughout the woods to find her. I want her back alive!” \n Annie is now at the river and she puts the book down and opens it to the page where it tells her how to bring her sister back to life. Annie starts the spell and just as she’s about to set her mother's hair on fire she gets thrown against a tree. Someone from the cult has found her, she uses all her might to fight the force. It had taken years to learn dark magic, but with all the anger and sadness she had built up in her she had found it easy to use dark magic. She was stronger than everyone on the dark side, her amount of pain could not be met by anyone else. She pulls free and throws Tibbers and chants a spell just as Tibbers is about to hit the ground he turns into a 10-foot bear. He takes Annie’s fury and kills the person who held her to the tree. She turns to him and tells him, “defend.” Tibber roars and Annie turns and gets back to her spell. She starts from the beginning, she sees her sister’s soul rise from the waterfall. She continues, she’s now at the end it's the last test, burn her mother’s strand of hair and kill her. Annie starts crying but she refused to turn back now, she creates a fireball in her hand and sets her mother's hair on fire. It’s been done, her mother is now gone. Annie looks down and starts crying.\n Mysterious Voice: “Annie?” \nShe wipes her tears and looks up, there she is, her sister standing before her.`

         text : `Annie looks at her mother and sees the heartbroken look on her face, she pulls away from Owen and runs to her mom\n Owen: “You’ll come around eventually,”\n Owen suddenly disappears. Annie feels hopeless and doesn’t believe she will find a way to bring back her sister. She goes to the chief elder and tells them about how she wants to bring back her sister but he tells her it isn't possible to bring her back. All that he is capable of is puttig her soul at rest. She asks how and he tells her to find the stone of the fallen angel. She must find out how to do it on her own. Annie goes to try and find the stone of the fallen angel but she doesn’t have any luck, she feels like giving up. \n Weeks pass by of her searching for books about the stone, massive piles now covered her room. She soon gives up and goes to the chief elder, but he dies before he can tell her more information. She goes door to door asking for help but no one knew anything. One day in her dreams she dream, she had a dream about the stone, an angel came to her and told her to look at the book for hidden messages, “What book?” she asks. The angel shows her an image of which book to look for. Annie wakes and desperately starts searching through the pile of books looking for it. She finds it, it was a weird-looking book, there was a big hole in the middle as if a circle had been cut through all the pages. She reads what she can day after day until she realizes, it was right in front of her the entire time. It wasn’t in the text, it was on the picture cover. She wondered why it looked familiar and she asked her mother. \n Annie's Mother: “That's the underground garden I used to take you to when you were just a baby.”\nAnnie kissed her mother thank you and then ran off.  Annie arrived at the garden and looked around, she compared the photo to the actual view looking for any difference. She noticed there was a crack that was not in the photo. Maybe the time had worn it down she thought, to be safe she took a look. The inside of the crack was filled with cobwebs and roaches she told herself to be strong, she stuck her hand in and felt around, she couldn’t feel anything but spiderwebs but then just as she was about to put out her arm, her hand hit something. Her hand had hit something, the stone, she had found it. She thought to herself, “Now what? I have the stone now what do I do with it?” “The hole! It has to be the hole!” she thought. She ran home with the book in one hand and the stone in the other. She ran to her room and slammed the door, she laid the book down and opened it. She grabbed the stone and placed it in the hole, a perfect fit. The book started to glow and the glow grew so bright that it blinded Annie, she closed her eyes and covered them with her arms. \n Random Voice: “Open your eyes.” \n She peeks through her arms, it’s her sister. \n Annie:“Is it you? Are you actually here?” \n Annie's Sister: “You’re unconscious, but I’m here, only in spirit, I’m here to thank you. Ever since I fell my soul hasn’t been at rest, my body was never found. It whittled over time and disappeared. I never had a body so I’ve been roaming as a spirit watching your every move, waiting to be saved, if I would ever be saved. I can finally be at peace now, thank you Annie, goodbye.” \n Annie woke up with a gasp and looked around her mother was shaking her trying to get her to wake up.\nAnnie's Mother: “Annie you’re here! I thought I had lost you!”\n Annie:“I saw her, I saw my sister. She’s at rest now.” \nHer mother looked at her and gave her the tightest hug.\n Annie's Mother: “You did it!” \nAnnie smiled and was so tired she fell right asleep. Annie went on with her life, years passed by, her mother and father were back together now, everything was just the way it should be.`
